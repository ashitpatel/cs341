Specifically, she alleged that: (1) she was assured the job would involve the chance to develop and implement human rights policies for the company s overseas operations, including the implementation of human rights risk assessments (HRRAs); and (2) she was assured that the job was more than a public relations role. After working at her job for a year, the plaintiff claimed that the majority of her duties consisted of external public relations matters, and claimed that her attempts to implement HRRAs and human rights training programmes for the company s overseas business operations were thwarted by her superiors. She alleged that the corporate structure of Statoil made it impossible for her to implement the human rights policies she thought she was hired to develop and institute. The plaintiff also claimed that her working environment became extremely stressful and impacted her health.The lawsuit was filed in US federal court in California. The plaintiff claimed she was subject to fraud and deceit and that the company breached California labour law. Statoil responded to the allegations by rejecting them as unfounded and incorrect . Statoil further stated that it takes its human rights responsibilities very seriously. In October 2012 the lawsuit was dismissed after the parties reached an out-of-court settlement. - Lov og rett i Statoil ASA [ Law and Justice at Statoil ], Simen S tre, Morgenbladet [Norway], 3 Sep 2010 [available in Norwegian only]- Til sak mot Statoil [ An action against Statoil ], Kristin Jonassen Nordby, Aftenposten [Norway], 3 Sep 2010 [available in Norwegian only]- Jeg ble syk av jobbe i Statoil [ I got sick from working for Statoil ], Toril Risholm, Aftenbladet [Norway], 1 Sep 2010 [available in Norwegian only]- Statoil tilbakeviser alle p stander [ Statoil refutes all allegations ], Aftenbladet [Norway], 1 Sep 2010 [available in Norwegian only] - Statoil: [DOC] Statement by Statoil Re: Human rights advisor sues Norwegian oil company over false representations about its commitment to respecting human rights, 24 Aug 2010- Paul Hoffman and Michael Seplow [counsel for plaintiff]: [PDF] Human Rights Advisor Sues Norwegian Oil Company Over False Rrepresentations About its Commitment to Respecting Human Rights , 17 Aug 2010 - [PDF] Complaint for Damages, in US District Court, Northern District of California, 17 Aug 2010\"\n",
